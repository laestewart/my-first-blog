Your First Django Project

C:\Users\Name\djangogirls> django-admin startproject mysite .
django-admin.py is a script that will create the directories and files for you. 

manage.py is a script that helps with management of the site. With it we will be able to start a web server on our computer without installing anything else, amongst other things.
The settings.py file contains the configuration of your website.
Remember when we talked about a mail carrier checking where to deliver a letter? urls.py file contains a list of patterns used by urlresolver.


Changing settings

Setup a database

There's a lot of different database software that can store data for your site. We'll use the default one, sqlite3.

This is already set up in this part of your mysite/settings.py file:

Sqlite is just one kind of database software. It's better for smaller sites, but others are like Oracle or Mysql

With Django you can change/replace your database. Depends on how much you need. 

Django comes with the software to create a sqlite3, but the migrate is what actually creates the database

"A database is a collection of data. This is a place in which you will store information about users, your blog posts, etc. We will be using a SQLite database to store our data. This is the default Django database adapter -- it'll be enough for us right now.""

Your website can have lots of different applications, like a blog app or a contact/form app. 
Almost all websites are a single application. Facebook or Google are things that have multiple applications (like Google Docs and Gmail)


The web server will take over your command prompt until you stop it. To type more commands whilst it is running open a new terminal window and activate your virtualenv. To stop the web server, switch back to the window in which it's running and pressing CTRL+C - Control and C buttons together
