Installation Notes

Moving up a folder level cd .. 

C:\Users\Laura> type "dir" to open a list of directories/folders

"mkdir" (make directory) + name of directory/folder you want to make

"cd" (change directory) opens the directory/folder that you want to work in

You can jump from directories/folders from each other without exiting to the main "Laura"/user directory 

"program" + "--help" 
*program is something like python, I think? Not django?

python comes with different options

"-m" tells python that we want to run an option 


-m" + "venv" + "name of new virtual environment you want to create"
Creates a new envionment but doesn't put you into it automatically

To open a virtual environment 
.\myvenv\Scripts\activate.bat
You can run it again if you want to double check that you are inside a virtual environment/the right one


You can save related shit (like these notes) inside the Djangogirls directory/folder and it's not going to fuck shit up


Tab + first letter will complete the folder name (as long as it's the only thing that starts with that letter inside that directory)



pip is a package management system

django is just one possible opensource packages that you can grab from online respositories 
Default repository for Python is PyPI

pip only works with Python

pip install "name of program"

the == defines a specific version of the package

package is directory of source code


django is code, mostly not with executable programs
django is a framework


QUESTION: Is there a way to tell when you are inside a virtual environment/which one

No, not in Windows. Actually yes in Linux


Ex: pip install django==1.9
